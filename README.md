# fcc-bonfires
My solutions and optimizations to the FreeCodeCamp bonfire algorithmic challenges. I will update the solutions if I come up with more efficient implementations.

The files are split into three directories (Each one corresponding to a different difficulty level):
-Basic
-Intermediate
-Upper Intermediate
-Advanced

I hope these are of some use to you all :)
